-Hi, I’m Thomas

-I'm interested in front-end or back end development, but also the field of computer science in general as I am still studying
and could easily have new passions spring up

-I'm currentlyn learning Java & Data Structures via the University of Minnesota Twin Cities' Computer Science program

-I’m interested in any internship opportunities that might be available. I currently know java and python, 
and will be learning much more in the near future

-I can be reached @knick073@umn.edu and @TCKnickerbocker@gmail.com
